## Lab Setup

1. [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install the latest release of the Java JDK.  The lab instructions have been tested with Java 8, so if you already have one installed you should be fine.
2. Optional - [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Maven 3 or greater if you do not already have it.
3. Download and install an IDE if you wish to use one.  The lab instructions are written for [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all), but you can use regular Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another IDE if desired. You can also work on all exercises without any IDE if you prefer.
4. Create a [Github](https://github.com) account, or be prepared to create a repository using another Git account that you already have access to.
